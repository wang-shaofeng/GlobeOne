                    <p class="article-paragraph">Have you experienced that your PHP
                        500 load for the week didn’t last for three days? Magugulat
                        ka na lang na back to zero na ‘yung load mo. Some might call
                        it “nakaw load” or “kain load.” But in reality, our load is
                        being used up by different call, text and surfing activities
                        on our devices. ‘Di lang natin napapansin.</p>

                    <p class="article-paragraph">Kayang-kaya namang iwasan ang biglaang
                        pagbawas ng load! Here are some reasons why you continue using up
                        your data and load even when you’re not on your phone.</p>

                        fter you’re done using it. For example, TikTok continues
                        to load videos in the background while you’re surfing on
                        Facebook. Since TikTok is still working in the background,
                        data and load are being used up without you realizing it.
                        It’s easy to avoid your apps from consuming more load in
                        three simple ways:</p>
